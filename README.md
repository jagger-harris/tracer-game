# Tracer Game

A hacking based sandbox game with a goal to be completely written in C.

Requires git and CMake 3.2 or later to build. My specific build script requires the Clang compiler to be installed.

## Testing Environment
* OS: Arch Linux
* Kernel: x86_64 5.19.2-zen1-1-zen

## Dependencies
* CMake 3.2 or later
* C compiler (Clang for my specific build script)

## Build and Run
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jagger-harris/tracer-game.git
cd tracer-game
./build.sh build run
```
